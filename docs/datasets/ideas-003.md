# State of the Art in IOC Detection, Risk Scoring, and Dataset Availability (2024-2025)

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of IOC detection, risk scoring methodologies, and the availability of multi-lingual and cross-platform datasets for cybersecurity applications. Based on extensive research conducted in January 2025, we identify significant gaps between technical possibilities and available resources, confirming the initial hypothesis that there is substantial room for collaboration and development in this space.

## Q1: State of the Art for Triage/Risk Scoring and IOC Classification

### Current Industry Standards (2024-2025)

#### Three-Tier Risk Classification Systems
Modern threat intelligence platforms have adopted sophisticated risk scoring frameworks:
- **Malicious**: Confirmed high-risk threats requiring immediate attention
- **Suspicious**: Potentially malicious IOCs requiring further investigation  
- **Informational**: Minimal risk but useful for monitoring trends

#### Advanced Scoring Methodologies

1. **MITRE ATT&CK Integration**
   - Risk-based TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) scoring
   - Correlation between AIM (Adversary Impact Model) and CVSS scores
   - Dynamic risk assessment based on operational threat relevance
   - Biannual updates with new threat groups and IoCs

2. **Contextual Intelligence Features**
   - **Sightings Data**: Tracking first/last observation, frequency across sources
   - **Relationship Mapping**: Connecting IOCs to malware families, C2 infrastructure
   - **Behavioral Analysis**: Shift from static IOCs to Indicators of Attack (IOAs)

3. **Performance Metrics (2025)**
   - Median dwell time: 10 days (down from 16 in 2022)
   - False positive rate: <0.1% with validated sources
   - Real-time detection capabilities with automated SIEM integration
   - ~15,000 unique IOCs processed daily by major platforms

### Key Players and Technologies

- **Flashpoint**: Enhanced IOC intelligence with risk scoring and relationship mapping
- **CrowdStrike**: IOA-based approach for proactive threat detection
- **IBM X-Force**: Integration of threat intelligence with vulnerability management
- **MITRE Corporation**: Continuous ATT&CK framework updates with real-world observations

### Gaps Identified

- Lack of standardized, universal risk scoring frameworks
- Limited integration between different scoring systems (CVSS, AIM, custom)
- Insufficient context-aware prioritization for organization-specific threats
- Need for ML-based confidence scoring and anomaly detection

## Q2: Multi-lingual Malicious/Benign String Datasets

### Available Datasets

#### Limited Multi-lingual Resources

1. **MultiJail Dataset**
   - First multilingual jailbreak dataset
   - 9+ languages from high to low resource
   - Focus on LLM security rather than traditional malware

2. **Email Phishing Datasets**
   - English and Arabic coverage
   - 97.37% Random Forest accuracy reported
   - Limited to email-based threats

3. **UC-SimList (Unicode Character Similarity List)**
   - Benchmark dataset for homoglyph detection
   - ~6,200 Unicode characters from 40+ languages
   - Focus on visual similarity attacks

### Unicode and Homoglyph Threats

#### Script-Specific Vulnerabilities
- **Cyrillic**: 11+ lowercase glyphs identical to Latin (most exploited)
- **Greek**: Omicron (ο) and nu (ν) confusion with Latin letters
- **Japanese**: Hiragana 'ん' mimicking forward slash in URLs
- **Arabic/Chinese**: Included in research but limited datasets

#### Detection Tools
- **ShamFinder**: Automated IDN homograph detection
- **REGAP**: Phishing IRI/IDN pattern generation
- **IDN-SecuChecker**: Unicode attack detection prototype

### Critical Gaps

1. **Language Coverage**
   - No comprehensive multi-lingual dataset with both malicious and benign strings

## Conclusion

The research confirms a significant gap between technical capabilities and available resources in IOC detection and threat analysis. While sophisticated frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK and advanced risk scoring systems exist, they lack standardization and comprehensive dataset support. The absence of multi-lingual string datasets and cross-platform binary collections severely limits the development of robust, globally-applicable security solutions.

The cybersecurity community would greatly benefit from collaborative efforts to:
1. Standardize risk scoring methodologies
2. Create comprehensive multi-lingual threat datasets
3. Build truly cross-platform binary collections
4. Develop living dataset platforms with continuous updates

These initiatives would bridge the current gap and enable the development of next-generation threat detection systems capable of handling the increasingly diverse and sophisticated threat landscape of 2025 and beyond.
